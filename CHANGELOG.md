# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- 11 UI flash-message strings in `Attachments` and `Web.ColumnManagement`
  (upload/attachment errors, column-save results) were calling
  `Gettext.gettext/2` / `Gettext.dgettext/3` directly instead of through the
  macros `use Gettext, backend: ...` provides — invisible to `mix
  gettext.extract` and therefore never reaching the `et`/`ru` catalogs. Fixed
  by switching both modules to `use Gettext, backend:
  PhoenixKitManufacturing.Gettext` + the `gettext`/`dgettext` macros; the 11
  strings are now translatable and et/ru translations are included ([PR
  #4](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_manufacturing/pull/4)).
  `Attachments`'s 5 strings were also incorrectly tied to the host app's
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext` backend rather than this module's own — now
  consistent with the rest of the module.

### Changed

- Routine dependency lockfile bumps (`mix.lock`).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-14

Everything merged to `main` since 0.2.0 was published to Hex — PR #2
(`PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` conformance) and PR #3 ("Machines completion,
UI/i18n polish, entities-backed directories") — plus the fixes from this
release's post-merge review. 0.2.0 consumers should treat this as the first
release carrying the full "Machines reference book" feature set described
in `AGENTS.md`.

### Added

- Dynamic `metadata` fields on the machine form, driven by each linked
  machine type's `field_template` (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Machines.merged_field_template/1`),
  with a hidden-route mini-editor (`Web.MachineTypeTemplateLive`) for editing
  a type's own template.
- Operations tab: every published `operation` (entities-backed) can be
  linked to a machine, each link optionally overriding the operation's own
  time-norm for that machine (`Machines.sync_machine_operations/3`).
- Files/attachments (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Attachments`, `Web.Components.FilesCard`)
  and a featured-image picker on the machine form.
- Comments tab, via the optional `phoenix_kit_comments` dependency
  (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Comments`).
- Per-user column selection/filtering/sorting for the machines list
  (`ColumnConfig`, `Web.ColumnManagement`, `Web.Components.ColumnModal`,
  `ViewConfigs`).
- `machine_type` / `operation` / `defect_reason` directories migrated off
  module-owned CRUD onto `phoenix_kit_entities`-backed blueprint entities,
  read through a new ETS+PubSub cache (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.EntitiesRegistry`)
  — see `dev_docs/ENTITIES_MIGRATION_SPEC.md`.
- Passport fields (`model`, `manufacture_year`, `commissioned_on`,
  `warranty_until`, maintenance schedule) and a soft location link
  (`location_uuid`/`space_uuid` via `phoenix_kit_locations`'s `PlacePicker`).
- `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` on all table-backed schemas, for runtime
  named-schema (`--prefix`) support.

### Changed

- `MachineTypeAssignment.changeset/2`: `machine_type_uuid` is now a soft
  reference into `phoenix_kit_entities` (no `belongs_to`/FK), and the
  changeset now declares `unique_constraint([:machine_uuid,
  :machine_type_uuid])` matching core's unique index — a duplicate type
  uuid now returns `{:error, :type_assignment_failed}` instead of raising.
- `EntitiesRegistry.do_reload/1`: the ETS-payload build is now wrapped in
  the same `Postgrex.Error :undefined_table` / `catch :exit` guard already
  used for blueprint provisioning — a host booting before
  `phoenix_kit_entities`' tables are migrated no longer crashes the
  supervision tree.
- `Web.MachineFormLive`'s dynamic `metadata` fields now read from the live
  changeset instead of the frozen `@machine` struct, so a typed-but-unsaved
  value survives toggling a machine type on/off.
- `Web.MachinesLive`'s featured-image thumbnails are now batch-resolved
  (one query for the whole list) instead of one `Storage.get_file/1` call
  per row per render.
- `Web.ColumnManagement.assign_column_state/2` now falls back to
  `default_columns()` when a persisted column selection validates down to
  an empty list (e.g. every saved column id was renamed/removed), instead
  of rendering a table with no data columns.
- `Comments.available?/0` now rescues and catches `:exit`, matching this
  module's convention for every other "is this optional dependency alive"
  check.
- `phoenix_kit` pin tightened to `~> 1.7.190`; `phoenix_kit_locations`
  pinned to `~> 0.3`.

See `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/3-machines-completion/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` for
the full PR #3 review, including documented-but-not-fixed follow-ups
(upload content-type hardening, abandoned-draft folder cleanup, and a couple
of render-path query-batching improvements).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Machines reference book** — full CRUD for manufacturing machines and
  their (many-to-many) machine types.
  - `Machine` schema: name, code, manufacturer, serial number, description,
    location note, status (`active` / `maintenance` / `decommissioned`),
    plus `data` (multilang) and freeform `metadata` JSONB columns.
  - `MachineType` schema: name, description, status (`active` / `inactive`),
    multilang `data`.
  - `MachineTypeAssignment` join schema with FK `assoc_constraint`s.
- `PhoenixKitManufacturing.Machines` context — list/get/count/create/update/
  delete for machines and types, many-to-many type sync in a transaction,
  and guarded activity logging under the `"manufacturing"` module key.
- Admin UI: `MachinesLive` (machines + types lists), `MachineFormLive`
  (core inputs + click-to-toggle type picker), and `MachineTypeFormLive`
  (multilang name/description via core `MultilangForm`).
- Module-owned database tables via `migration_module/0`
  (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Migrations.Machines`) — the host applies them by
  running `mix phoenix_kit.update`.
- Admin nav: the Manufacturing tab now carries **Dashboard**, **Machines**
  and **Types** subtabs (plus hidden create/edit form routes).
- Dashboard now shows live machine / machine-type counts (loaded in
  `handle_params/3`, degrading to `—` when the tables have not been migrated
  yet).
- `PhoenixKitManufacturing.Errors` — centralized error-atom → message mapping.
- i18n: gettext catalog re-synced to cover all module strings — complete
  English (source) and Russian translations, plus an Estonian subset (the
  remainder falls back to English).
- Module infrastructure: `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `config/`, test suite,
  and `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- `enable_system/0` / `disable_system/0` now log the module toggle through
  the context (`Machines.log_module_toggle/1`), which records the module key
  and degrades gracefully when core's activity table is missing.
- `mix.exs`: `phoenix_kit` now resolves via the `pk_dep/3` helper (honours
  `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH` for local cross-repo work); bumped `phoenix_live_view`
  to `~> 1.1`; added `test.setup` / `test.reset` aliases and the `lazy_html`
  test dependency.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Initial scaffold: `PhoenixKit.Module` registration (key `manufacturing`,
  enabled via the `manufacturing_enabled` setting), admin dashboard stub, and
  centralized `Paths` helpers.
- en / et / ru translations for the dashboard.
