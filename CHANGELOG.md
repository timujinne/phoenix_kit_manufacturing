# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Media reorganizer source for machines** (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.MediaReorganizer`,
  registered via `media_reorganizer/0`, used by core's
  `mix phoenix_kit.media.reorganize` on phoenix_kit ≥ 2.24.0). Plans moving
  existing machine attachment folders under the parent set by the
  `:attachments_parent_folder` hook and fills in any missing
  `data["files_folder_uuid"]` pointers. Folders it can't place safely are
  reported instead of moved: duplicates, stray copies, orphans of deleted
  machines, and folders when the hook fails or returns root. Stale empty
  `machine-attachment-pending-*` folders are trashed. Without a configured
  hook, it only produces reports.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies: `phoenix_kit` 2.24.0, `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.4.8,
  `phoenix_kit_entities` 0.4.15, `phoenix_kit_locations` 0.5.1,
  `phoenix_live_view` 1.2.12.

## 0.4.3 - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Attachment folders (machines) can be created under a host-configured
  parent folder instead of always landing at the storage root:
  `config :phoenix_kit_manufacturing, :attachments_parent_folder, {Mod, :fun}`,
  called as `Mod.fun("machine", actor_uuid)` and returning
  `{:ok, parent_folder_uuid}` or `nil`. Folder lookups by name now check the
  parent first and the root second, so folders created before the setting
  is turned on are still found. No behaviour change without the config.
  A hook that raises is logged and falls back to the root instead of
  crashing the machine form.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies: `phoenix` 1.8.14, `phoenix_kit` 2.23.1,
  `phoenix_kit_entities` 0.4.13, `beamlab_countries` 1.2.1.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **Saving or editing on the machine form's Operations / Files tab crashed the
  LiveView.** Those tabs sit inside the same `#machine-form` as General but
  render none of the `machine[...]` inputs, so their `phx-change` (typing in
  a time-norm override, dropping a file) and `phx-submit` payloads carry no
  `"machine"` key — and both handlers pattern-matched on it, raising a
  `FunctionClauseError` on every keystroke and on Save. `validate` is now a
  no-op there, and Save falls back to the params of the last General-tab
  `validate`, so a name typed on General before switching tabs is saved
  rather than dropped.

- **Machines list per-column filter forms now carry stable ids**, so LiveView
  can restore a half-typed filter after a reconnect (they were `phx-change`
  forms with no `id`, which LiveView warns about).

- **Test suite** against the current lock (`phoenix_kit` 2.23,
  `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.4.7): the fake test scope now wraps a real
  `%PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.User{}` (the embedded comments component runs it
  through `Roles.user_has_role_owner?/1`, which heads on the struct), the
  delete-flow test targets the table row menu instead of an ambiguous
  selector that also matched the card view, and the Operations-tab tests
  submit what the browser actually sends from that tab.

### Changed

- The manufacturing dashboard uses the full admin content width instead of
  a centred 768px column (#11).
- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.23.0, `phoenix_kit_entities` 0.4.12,
  `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.4.7, `phoenix_kit_locations` 0.4.2,
  `phoenix_live_view` 1.2.11).

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **`priv/` is now shipped in the Hex package** (#9). It was missing from the
  `files:` list, so `priv/gettext` never reached anyone installing from Hex and
  every string rendered as its English msgid no matter what locale the host was
  in. The translations were only ever working for people running from a
  checkout of this repo.

- **The "Machine Type Template" tab had no msgid at all** (#9), so it stayed
  English even once the catalogues shipped. Estonian "Edit Machine" and Russian
  "Machine Comments" / "Edit" were also corrected to their proper case and
  wording.

### Changed

- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.2.0, `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.4.0,
  `phoenix_kit_locations` 0.4.1, `phoenix` 1.8.10, `hackney` 4.7.3).

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **⚠️ Requires `phoenix_kit ~> 2.0`.** The core pin moved to `~> 2.0`, so this
  release no longer resolves against core 1.7.

  Core 2.0.0 squashes the migration chain into a single `V135` baseline and makes
  V135 the chain's floor: `mix ecto.migrate` now *refuses* on a database below it
  rather than migrating. Check `mix phoenix_kit.status` **before** upgrading. A
  host below V135 must install `phoenix_kit 1.7.236` — the migration bridge, the
  last release carrying the full pre-squash chain — migrate until the reported
  version is at least V135, and only then move to 2.0.

  This package does not call migration internals, so the change is the pin
  itself.

- Sibling pins raised in step, each to that package's first release requiring
  core 2.0: `phoenix_kit_comments` → `~> 0.3`, `phoenix_kit_entities` → `~> 0.3`,
  `phoenix_kit_locations` → `~> 0.4`. `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.3.0 is a
  **security release** (stored XSS in comment bodies); see its CHANGELOG.
- `test/dependency_floors_test.exs` reframed for the new contract. Its cases
  asserted each requirement still *admitted* the release that first shipped the
  API this module calls — true while every pin sat just above its marker, false
  once the pins moved far above it. The half that still catches a real mistake
  (a pin drifting back **down** past an API in use) is kept, and a new case
  asserts every sibling pin resolves a core-2.0-era release.
- `mix precommit` passes again. Three pre-existing credo findings were blocking
  it: two too-deeply-nested filter closures in `ColumnConfig` extracted into
  named helpers, and `ColumnConfig.Machines.columns/0` (cyclomatic complexity
  16 — every column definition's anonymous functions count as branches) split
  into `identity_columns/0` + `placement_columns/0` + `date_columns/0`, order
  preserved. Two nested-module references aliased; the third is inside a
  `__using__` macro where the fully-qualified name is required for hygiene, so
  that one carries a targeted `credo:disable-for-next-line` instead.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- The published `phoenix_kit` requirement named a release older than this
  module itself and permitted a core without `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState`,
  which `Web.MachinesLive` `use`s. A consumer whose resolution landed below
  1.7.231 got a package that fails to compile, or — with a precompiled
  artefact, since the `on_mount` tuple is baked into the `.beam` — raises on
  the first mount of the machines list. Floor raised to `~> 1.7.231`, the
  release that first published `UrlState`
  ([PR #7](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_manufacturing/pull/7)).
- The `phoenix_kit_comments` requirement had the same defect and was two
  releases further behind: `~> 0.2` permitted 0.2.0, but
  `Web.MachineFormLive` `use`s `PhoenixKitComments.Embed` (0.2.6) and
  `Manufacturing.Comments` calls `subscribe/2`, `unsubscribe/2` and the list
  form of `count_comments/3` (all 0.2.8). The `Code.ensure_loaded?` guards
  cover the module being absent, not an older one missing functions. Floor
  raised to `~> 0.2.8`.

### Internal

- Post-merge review of #7:
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/7-core-version-floor/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.
- `test/dependency_floors_test.exs` asserts each sibling dep's requirement
  rejects the last release without the API this module uses and accepts the
  first release with it, so a floor can no longer drift below an API in use.
  No-ops for deps swapped to a local checkout via `<APP>_PATH`.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-08-05

### Added

- The machines list's search and sort now live in the query string (`?q=`,
  `?sort=`, `?dir=`) via core's `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState`, so a filtered
  list is a real URL — shareable, reload-proof, and Back returns to the
  previous query instead of leaving the page
  ([PR #6](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_manufacturing/pull/6)).
  The list loads in `handle_url_state/2`, so first paint, a shared link and a
  Back press all take one code path. Per-column filter values deliberately
  stay out of the URL — compound values need a nested encoding that hasn't
  been designed yet.
- `ColumnConfig.sortable_column_ids/0`, alongside the existing
  `all_column_ids/0`.

### Fixed

- A column-modal save or a filter change could leave the machines list stale
  when the active sort column was hidden: `__view_config_changed__/1` relied
  on the resulting URL patch to reload, but a patch that resolves to the
  current state is skipped by `UrlState.reload?/3`, and nothing else
  recomputed the list. It now reloads directly when there is no URL change to
  make.
- The sort fallback for a hidden sort column picked the first *visible*
  column, which can be the non-sortable `types` — sanitized back to the
  hidden `name`, leaving the list sorted by an invisible column with the sort
  control sitting on an unrelated one. It now picks the first *sortable*
  visible column.
- The `?sort=` whitelist is derived from `ColumnConfig.Machines` at compile
  time instead of being a hand-copied second list, so adding a sortable
  column can no longer silently leave its header un-clickable.

### Changed

- Bumped the `phoenix_kit` lock pin to `1.7.231` and dropped eight lock
  entries orphaned by the upgrade (`igniter` and its transitive deps).
- Removed the `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` entry for `permission_metadata/0`'s
  `callback_type_mismatch`: `phoenix_kit` 1.7.231 ships core PR #651, which
  widens `permission_meta()` to accept `gettext_backend`/`gettext_domain`, so
  the permission-label translation added in 0.3.2 is now live rather than
  inert.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- `permission_metadata/0` now declares `gettext_backend`/`gettext_domain`, so
  the "Manufacturing" row in the admin permissions matrix renders translated
  in the UI locale, matching how `admin_tabs/0` already translates the
  sidebar label ([PR #5](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_manufacturing/pull/5)).
  Inert until a `phoenix_kit` release including core PR #651 is published and
  pinned — the extra keys are silently ignored by every core version
  published so far.
- Bumped the `phoenix_kit` lock pin to the latest Hex release (`1.7.205`) and
  cleaned an orphaned `beamlab_ex_aws_sqs` 4.0.0 lock entry left behind by
  core renaming its internal SQS dependency key.

### Fixed

- Declaring `permission_metadata/0`'s new keys tripped `mix dialyzer`'s
  callback-type check, since no published `phoenix_kit` version yet widens
  `permission_meta()` to include them — added a scoped, explained
  `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` entry to keep the gate green until core ships and
  the lock is bumped past it. See the [PR #5
  review](dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/5-permission-label-i18n/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md)
  for the full timeline.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- 11 UI flash-message strings in `Attachments` and `Web.ColumnManagement`
  (upload/attachment errors, column-save results) were calling
  `Gettext.gettext/2` / `Gettext.dgettext/3` directly instead of through the
  macros `use Gettext, backend: ...` provides — invisible to `mix
  gettext.extract` and therefore never reaching the `et`/`ru` catalogs. Fixed
  by switching both modules to `use Gettext, backend:
  PhoenixKitManufacturing.Gettext` + the `gettext`/`dgettext` macros; the 11
  strings are now translatable and et/ru translations are included ([PR
  #4](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_manufacturing/pull/4)).
  `Attachments`'s 5 strings were also incorrectly tied to the host app's
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext` backend rather than this module's own — now
  consistent with the rest of the module.

### Changed

- Routine dependency lockfile bumps (`mix.lock`).
- Removed 6 stale, unused entries from `mix.lock` (`ex_aws_sqs`, `httpoison`,
  `jose`, `metrics`, `ueberauth_apple`, `unicode_util_compat`) — orphaned
  since `phoenix_kit` dropped `ueberauth_apple` support around 1.7.191 but
  never pruned from this repo's lockfile. Includes `ueberauth_apple 0.6.1`,
  which carries a CRITICAL advisory (CVE-2026-55954, account takeover via
  missing ID token claim validation); it was not a declared dependency of
  this package and never shipped to consumers (`mix.lock` isn't published to
  Hex), but `mix hex.audit` now passes clean.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-14

Everything merged to `main` since 0.2.0 was published to Hex — PR #2
(`PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` conformance) and PR #3 ("Machines completion,
UI/i18n polish, entities-backed directories") — plus the fixes from this
release's post-merge review. 0.2.0 consumers should treat this as the first
release carrying the full "Machines reference book" feature set described
in `AGENTS.md`.

### Added

- Dynamic `metadata` fields on the machine form, driven by each linked
  machine type's `field_template` (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Machines.merged_field_template/1`),
  with a hidden-route mini-editor (`Web.MachineTypeTemplateLive`) for editing
  a type's own template.
- Operations tab: every published `operation` (entities-backed) can be
  linked to a machine, each link optionally overriding the operation's own
  time-norm for that machine (`Machines.sync_machine_operations/3`).
- Files/attachments (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Attachments`, `Web.Components.FilesCard`)
  and a featured-image picker on the machine form.
- Comments tab, via the optional `phoenix_kit_comments` dependency
  (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Comments`).
- Per-user column selection/filtering/sorting for the machines list
  (`ColumnConfig`, `Web.ColumnManagement`, `Web.Components.ColumnModal`,
  `ViewConfigs`).
- `machine_type` / `operation` / `defect_reason` directories migrated off
  module-owned CRUD onto `phoenix_kit_entities`-backed blueprint entities,
  read through a new ETS+PubSub cache (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.EntitiesRegistry`)
  — see `dev_docs/ENTITIES_MIGRATION_SPEC.md`.
- Passport fields (`model`, `manufacture_year`, `commissioned_on`,
  `warranty_until`, maintenance schedule) and a soft location link
  (`location_uuid`/`space_uuid` via `phoenix_kit_locations`'s `PlacePicker`).
- `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix` on all table-backed schemas, for runtime
  named-schema (`--prefix`) support.

### Changed

- `MachineTypeAssignment.changeset/2`: `machine_type_uuid` is now a soft
  reference into `phoenix_kit_entities` (no `belongs_to`/FK), and the
  changeset now declares `unique_constraint([:machine_uuid,
  :machine_type_uuid])` matching core's unique index — a duplicate type
  uuid now returns `{:error, :type_assignment_failed}` instead of raising.
- `EntitiesRegistry.do_reload/1`: the ETS-payload build is now wrapped in
  the same `Postgrex.Error :undefined_table` / `catch :exit` guard already
  used for blueprint provisioning — a host booting before
  `phoenix_kit_entities`' tables are migrated no longer crashes the
  supervision tree.
- `Web.MachineFormLive`'s dynamic `metadata` fields now read from the live
  changeset instead of the frozen `@machine` struct, so a typed-but-unsaved
  value survives toggling a machine type on/off.
- `Web.MachinesLive`'s featured-image thumbnails are now batch-resolved
  (one query for the whole list) instead of one `Storage.get_file/1` call
  per row per render.
- `Web.ColumnManagement.assign_column_state/2` now falls back to
  `default_columns()` when a persisted column selection validates down to
  an empty list (e.g. every saved column id was renamed/removed), instead
  of rendering a table with no data columns.
- `Comments.available?/0` now rescues and catches `:exit`, matching this
  module's convention for every other "is this optional dependency alive"
  check.
- `phoenix_kit` pin tightened to `~> 1.7.190`; `phoenix_kit_locations`
  pinned to `~> 0.3`.

See `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/3-machines-completion/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` for
the full PR #3 review, including documented-but-not-fixed follow-ups
(upload content-type hardening, abandoned-draft folder cleanup, and a couple
of render-path query-batching improvements).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Machines reference book** — full CRUD for manufacturing machines and
  their (many-to-many) machine types.
  - `Machine` schema: name, code, manufacturer, serial number, description,
    location note, status (`active` / `maintenance` / `decommissioned`),
    plus `data` (multilang) and freeform `metadata` JSONB columns.
  - `MachineType` schema: name, description, status (`active` / `inactive`),
    multilang `data`.
  - `MachineTypeAssignment` join schema with FK `assoc_constraint`s.
- `PhoenixKitManufacturing.Machines` context — list/get/count/create/update/
  delete for machines and types, many-to-many type sync in a transaction,
  and guarded activity logging under the `"manufacturing"` module key.
- Admin UI: `MachinesLive` (machines + types lists), `MachineFormLive`
  (core inputs + click-to-toggle type picker), and `MachineTypeFormLive`
  (multilang name/description via core `MultilangForm`).
- Module-owned database tables via `migration_module/0`
  (`PhoenixKitManufacturing.Migrations.Machines`) — the host applies them by
  running `mix phoenix_kit.update`.
- Admin nav: the Manufacturing tab now carries **Dashboard**, **Machines**
  and **Types** subtabs (plus hidden create/edit form routes).
- Dashboard now shows live machine / machine-type counts (loaded in
  `handle_params/3`, degrading to `—` when the tables have not been migrated
  yet).
- `PhoenixKitManufacturing.Errors` — centralized error-atom → message mapping.
- i18n: gettext catalog re-synced to cover all module strings — complete
  English (source) and Russian translations, plus an Estonian subset (the
  remainder falls back to English).
- Module infrastructure: `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `config/`, test suite,
  and `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- `enable_system/0` / `disable_system/0` now log the module toggle through
  the context (`Machines.log_module_toggle/1`), which records the module key
  and degrades gracefully when core's activity table is missing.
- `mix.exs`: `phoenix_kit` now resolves via the `pk_dep/3` helper (honours
  `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH` for local cross-repo work); bumped `phoenix_live_view`
  to `~> 1.1`; added `test.setup` / `test.reset` aliases and the `lazy_html`
  test dependency.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Initial scaffold: `PhoenixKit.Module` registration (key `manufacturing`,
  enabled via the `manufacturing_enabled` setting), admin dashboard stub, and
  centralized `Paths` helpers.
- en / et / ru translations for the dashboard.
