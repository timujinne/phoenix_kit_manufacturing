defmodule PhoenixKitManufacturing.Errors do
  @moduledoc """
  Central mapping from error atoms (returned by the Manufacturing module's
  public API and used across its LiveViews) to translated human-readable
  strings.

  Keeping UI-facing copy in one place means every "not found" or "delete
  failed" flash reads the same wording. Callers pattern-match on atoms;
  `message/1` wraps each mapping in `gettext/1` at the UI boundary.

  ## Supported reason shapes

    * plain atoms — `:machine_not_found`, `:type_assignment_failed`, etc.
    * strings — passed through unchanged
    * anything else — rendered as `"Unexpected error: <inspect>"`

  ## Example

      iex> PhoenixKitManufacturing.Errors.message(:machine_not_found)
      "Machine not found."
