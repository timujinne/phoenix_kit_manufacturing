  # Gettext backend plural dispatch (introduced by the first `ngettext` call
  # in this module, in `Web.MachinesLive`'s "N filters active" indicator).
  # Dialyzer can't reconcile the opaque `Expo.PluralForms` type inside the
  # compiled `lngettext/7` clauses with the literal struct terms the Gettext
  # compiler generates per locale — a known false positive in this codebase
  # family, see the analogous skip in phoenix_kit's own .dialyzer_ignore.exs.
