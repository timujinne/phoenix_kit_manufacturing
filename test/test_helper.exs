# Test helper for the PhoenixKitManufacturing test suite.
#
# Level 1: Unit tests (schemas, changesets, pure functions) always run.
# Level 2: Integration tests require PostgreSQL — automatically excluded
#          when the database is unavailable (`:integration` tag).
#
# To enable integration tests:
#
#     mix test.setup           # createdb
#     mix test
#
# The test endpoint runs with `server: false` (no port opened); LiveView
# tests drive it via `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.live/2` only.

# Elixir 1.19's `mix test` no longer auto-loads modules from the
# `:elixirc_paths` test directories at test-helper time — only files
# matching `:test_load_filters` get loaded by the test runner. Our support
# modules are compiled but not loaded, so explicit `Code.require_file/2`
# calls are needed before this file references them.

# Start minimal PhoenixKit services *before* touching the database.
# `EntitiesRegistry.init/1` (started, and immediately stopped again, once
# below to seed its blueprint entities ahead of any per-test sandbox
# transaction) calls `PhoenixKitEntities.Entities.create_entity/2` /
# `EntityData.create/2`, both of which unconditionally broadcast a PubSub
# event on success (`PhoenixKitEntities.Events`, routed through
# `PhoenixKit.PubSub.Manager`). `Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast/3` raises
# `ArgumentError` ("unknown registry: :phoenix_kit_internal_pubsub") when
# that named PubSub isn't started yet — which, before this reorder, was
# the case here (`PubSub.Manager` used to start *after* the provisioning
# step ran below), so every real-database `mix test` run hit that raise
# inside the `try` block below, got caught by its `rescue`, and silently
# mis-reported "could not connect to test database" — excluding every
# `:integration` test even with Postgres up and reachable. `ModuleRegistry`
# has no such ordering constraint but is started alongside it for the same
# reason the two were already grouped together.
